		<h1>Who are the Tanitians?</h1>
		<h5>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWith an indigenous population of over twenty-thousand people, Tanitians hold a rich, long and traditional 
		lifestyle.</h5>
		<h5>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTanitian economy has long been dominated by fishing and agriculture. Once the intrigue of tourism took hold, 
		the locals saw the potential and embraced tourism as reliable and highly profitable.</h5> 
		<h5>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe rural areas still hold true to tradition, but the larger cities embrace outside cutlures and welcome the 
		opportunities that come with exposure to such a variety of people.</h5><br><br>
